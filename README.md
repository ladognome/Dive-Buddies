Dive Buddies: An App for Marine Exploration
======================================================================
This application was made to help recreational divers better understand their underwater environment.

Installation
---------------------------------------------
We have provided two APK files (for armv7 & x86 processors). Please select the one that will work for your Android phone. If you are not sure which one will work, you can try them both and only one will be able to install. You will have to enable installation from "unknown sources" under Security in your settings. Since we worked with Intel XDK**, we can create other installation files for various browsers, the Windows phone, or the iPhone, if requested.

In order to start the application, make sure that your GPS is turned on, in addition to either your data or wifi.

Start-Up
---------------------------------------------
After you install the application, click on the splashscreen to go to the next page where you will enter your location or choose to use your current location. Based on the location you select, you will see a list of dive spots in that area. Select the one you want, and you will be taken to a screen where you can choose to enter the pre-dive or post-dive portions of the application, in addition to a few external links.

Pre-Dive
---------------------------------------------
Given the location of the dive spot you selected, the application will display a list of marine animals with their picture, also displaying a little caution symbol if they are toxic. By default, it loads fish, but you can also select mollusks or corals. If you click on an animal, it will give you more information.

Post-Dive
---------------------------------------------
Type a textual description of an animal and it will give a list of possible marine animals that it thinks you might have seen. Again, clicking on an animal will provide more information about that animal. This section of the application does not take into account your location, as of yet.
